The visual above presents data on the number of perfect seasons required by teams across various leagues to achieve a .500 winning percentage. Currently, it's displayed as a simple bar plot, grouped by league. \[1\]

To make it easier to analyze each league individually, especially since the original plot includes numerous teams, we propose redesigning the visualization. By splitting the plot by league and transforming it into a series of line plots, we can gain clearer insights into each league's performance and trends.

```{r, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

### Redesigned Visual 1

```{r, fig.width=8, echo = FALSE, fig.height=11, warning=FALSE}

dataset <- read.csv("C:/Users/adikh/OneDrive/Desktop/Stat/AnkitBorle/Dataset/StatDataset.csv")

p1 = ggplot(dataset, aes(x = reorder(Team, -Perfect.Seasons.Needed), y = Perfect.Seasons.Needed, group = League))+
  geom_point(aes(color = League), size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(color = League)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "right")   + 
  facet_wrap(~League, scales = "free_x", nrow = 3) +
  labs(x = "Team",
       y = "Perfect Seasons Needed")

#ggplotly(p1)
p1
```

As observed from the league-wise insights, we can analyze not only how teams perform but also identify which teams require the highest and lowest number of perfect seasons to reach a .500 winning percentage. This allows us to determine if teams within a league are generally consistent or if there's a clear outlier. For example, in the NFL, the Los Angeles Chargers are leading, needing less than a season to reach .500, while the Arizona Cardinals are struggling, requiring 12 seasons to hit the same mark.

Next, we will create a plot that provides deeper insights into each league by displaying key metrics such as the highest and lowest number of seasons required to reach .500, as well as other important data points. This will be visualized using a box plot, offering a clear view of the overall performance distribution within each league. To enhance the analysis, we aim to make the box plot interactive, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the data.

### Redesigned Visual 2

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p2 = ggplot(dataset, aes(x = League, y = Perfect.Seasons.Needed, fill = League)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Perfect Seasons Needed by League",
       x = "League", y = "Perfect Seasons Needed")

ggplotly(p2)
```

From the box plot above, we can gather a wealth of information, including summary statistics grouped by league. This allows us to easily identify key metrics such as the minimum value, maximum value, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), and more. These insights help us better understand the distribution of team performances within each league.

A shorter box indicates a more competitive league, where teams are performing at a similar level. In contrast, a longer box suggests one dominant team and weaker competition from others. In the first redesign, the plot for the NFL shows the Los Angeles Chargers dominating, as they need less than a season, while the Arizona Cardinals appear as the weakest team, requiring the most seasons. In contrast, the second redesign for the NFL shows a longer box, indicating a greater disparity between teams. Meanwhile, for the MLS, the box is shorter, reflecting stronger competition and more evenly matched teams. This trend is consistent in the first redesign for MLS, where the number of seasons required by each team is nearly the same.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the original visual had a few challenges, making it difficult to identify league-wise performances due to the overcrowding of teams in a single plot, which made trend analysis harder. To address this, we created a line chart grouped by each league, allowing us to easily spot patterns, such as the strongest team and the overall level of competition within the league. We then further refined the design by creating a box plot for each league, providing statistical insights like the distribution of teams, the most common performance range, and the extreme outliers in each league.

## 2. Original Visual

The visual above presents data on the global demand for palm oil exports. The graphic illustrates how much palm oil various countries import from Indonesia, as well as the scale of exports, with lines connecting Indonesia to different parts of the world, indicating export volume in monetary terms. \[2\]

To enhance clarity regarding the countries that import the largest quantities of palm oil from Indonesia, we have created a horizontal bar graph. This graph is organized in descending order, from the highest to the lowest share of imports. Additionally, the data is categorized by the continent to which each country belongs, allowing for an analysis of which continent is the primary importer of palm oil from Indonesia.

```{r, fig.width=5, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}

data <- read.csv('C:/Users/adikh/OneDrive/Desktop/Stat/AnkitBorle/Dataset/stat_proj.csv')

#Plotting Bar Graph
bar_graph<-ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(region, dollars_millions), y = dollars_millions))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', aes(fill = continent))+
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Share of countries by palm oil import", y = "Dollars (in Millions)", x = "Region", fill = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal()
  
#Converting Bar Graph to Interactive Grapgh
ggplotly(bar_graph)
```

The aforementioned chart illustrates that China stands as the foremost importer of palm oil from Indonesia, commanding a market share valued at 2.6 billion dollars. This is succeeded by India, with imports amounting to 2.3 billion dollars, and Pakistan, which imports 1.2 billion dollars. In contrast, the countries with the lowest import figures include South Africa at 172 million dollars, South Korea at 169 million dollars, and Benin at 124 million dollars. Furthermore, it can be deduced that Asia is the predominant continent for palm oil imports, while North America ranks as the continent with the least imports.

Same information can be deduced from the below given weighted scatter graph where the dots have size according to their share towards the import of palm oil.

```{r, fig.width=8, echo = FALSE, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}

#Plotting Weighted Scatter Graph
scatter <- ggplot(data, aes(x = region, y = dollars_millions, size = dollars_millions, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 15)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = dollars_millions), 
            vjust = 0.5,
            hjust = 0.5,
            color = "black",
            size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(title = "Share of countries by palm oil export",
       x = "Region",
       y = "Dollars (in Millions)",
       color = "Continent")+
  guides(size = "none")

scatter

```

The distribution of palm oil imports has been illustrated on a world map through an interactive format. Nations with the highest levels of imports are represented in darker shades, while those with lower import volumes are shown in lighter shades.

```{r, fig.width=11, echo = FALSE, fig.height=8, warning=FALSE}

world_tbl <- map_data("world") %>% as_tibble()

left <- left_join(world_tbl, data, by="region")

map1 <- ggplot(left, aes( x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = dollars_millions), color = "black")+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "white", mid = "yellow", high = "red", midpoint = 1500)+
  labs(title = "Region wise share of palm oil export",
       x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       fill = "Million Dollars")

ggplotly(map1)

```

The regions exhibiting the highest levels of imports are represented in darker hues, with China leading as the largest importer, indicated by the color red. Following China, India is depicted in orange, while the regions with the lowest imports are shown in lighter shades. Notably, Benin, South Korea, and South Africa are represented by nearly white colors.

### Special Effort

We manually created the dataset from the visuals, as it was not readily available in the original article. This extra effort ensured we had data for the analysis and visual redesign.
